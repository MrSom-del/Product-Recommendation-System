# Product-Recommendation-System
A Product Recommendation System built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It uses content-based filtering with TF-IDF and cosine similarity to suggest similar products based on descriptions. The interactive app demonstrates how machine learning enhances product discovery, personalization, and user experience in e-commerce platforms.
The `artefacts/` directory containing trained model files is excluded from the repository.
These files can be regenerated by running the data preparation script.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies  
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the application  
   streamlit run app.py
   

## How the Recommendation System Works

This project uses a content-based filtering approach to recommend products based on textual similarity.

1. Product attributes such as name, brand, category, sub-category, and description are combined into a single text representation for each product.
2. The combined text is converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency), which highlights important and distinguishing words.
3. When a user selects a product, its TF-IDF vector is compared with all other product vectors using cosine similarity.
4. Cosine similarity measures how closely related two products are based on the angle between their vectors.
5. Products with the highest similarity scores are ranked and the top results are displayed as recommendations.

This approach does not require user history and works efficiently even for new products, making it suitable for cold-start scenarios.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **BigBasket Products.csv**, sourced from **Kaggle**.  
It contains product information such as product name, brand, category, and description.  
The dataset is used strictly for educational and learning purposes.
